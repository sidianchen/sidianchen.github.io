# New Code Release: Semi-Analytical & Numerical Models for PFAS Transport in Heterogeneous Vadose Zones

Iâ€™m excited to announce that the code for our recently accepted manuscript is now publicly available!

**Manuscript:**  
*Semi-analytical solutions for nonequilibrium transport and transformation of PFAS and other solutes in heterogeneous vadose zones with structured porous media*  
*Advances in Water Resources* (Accepted)

This code implements both the semi-analytical and numerical models from our study, allowing simulation of PFAS and other solute transport and transformation in heterogeneous vadose zones with structured porous media. It provides a versatile tool for exploring nonequilibrium processes in complex subsurface environments.

**Access the code on GitHub:** [SemiAnalyticalSoln-PFAS-HeteroVZ](https://github.com/GuoSFPLab/SemiAnalyticalSoln-PFAS-HeteroVZ)

We welcome the community to explore, use, and provide feedback!
