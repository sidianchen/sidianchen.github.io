On Jan 04, 2024, I started a PostDoc position at the Department of Energy Science \& Engineering at Stanford University. I will work with Prof. Hamdi Tchelepi and conduct research on hydrogen storage in geological formations and next-generation energy storage solutions (i.e., rechargeable metal batteries). The goal of my research will focus on addressing grand challenges in global energy transition and climate change mitigation.
