## EDUCATION
- Ph.D., Hydrology (major) and Applied Math (minor), University of Arizona, 2018 - 2023
- M.S., Environmental Science, Peking University, 2015 - 2018
- B.S., Hydraulic and Hydropower Engineering, Tsinghua University, 2011 - 2015

## RESEARCH INTEREST
I am broadly interested in the fundamental physics of fluid flow and transport in environmental and energy systems in Earth's subsurface. My current research focuses on micro-scale (i.e., pore-scale) modeling of multiphase fluid flow, transport, and thermodynamic phase change behaviors in geological porous media. The specific application of my research is to study the transport of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in the vadose zone, the nonisothermal evaporation processes at the land surface, and the production of gas/oil from shale formations.
