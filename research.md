## Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) transport in partially water-saturated soils
> PFAS contamination in the vadose zone and groundwater is becoming a major health concern. Quantifying PFAS transport in the complex subsurface systems has been challenging due to the accumulation of interfacially-active PFAS at air-water interfaces of partially water-saturated soil pore spaces, and their partitioning at different air-water interfaces including those reside between soil grains and those arise in thin water films on soil grain surfaces. To address these challenges, I develop mechanistic pore-scale models and analytical upscaling frameworks that capture the physical transport mechanisms unique to PFAS. The ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between pore-scale understands and field-scale modeling concepts for better characterizing the PFAS transport behaviors and developing effective remediation strategies in the real-world subsurface environment.
