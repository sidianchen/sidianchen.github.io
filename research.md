## Compositional flow and thermodynamics in nanoporous media
> Nanometer-scale pore spaces in porous materials induce anomalous physical behaviors in terms of fluid flow, chemical compound transport, and thermodynamic phase change. These anomalous behaviors&mdash;commonly observed for oil and gas in shale formations&mdash;have posed significant challenges for accurate prediction of shale oil/gas production. Current theories either underrepresent the complex multiscale pore structures by using molecular dynamics or oversimplify the nanoconfined flow mechanisms by using Darcy-scale continuum models, causing inconsistent predictions with experimental and field observations. To bridge the gap, I develop a group of novel pore-network modeling frameworks to examine how complex nanopore networks control phase change and compositional flow dynamics. The objectives are to derive new constitutive relationships for reservoir-scale models and improve quantitative predictions of hydrocarbon production from complex shale formations.

## PFAS transport in partially water-saturated soils
> The wide spread of Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)&mdash;a group of interfacially-active emerging contaminants&mdash;has been posing great health risks to subsurface drinking water resources. Quantifying PFAS transport in the subsurface has been challenging due to the accumulation of PFAS at air-water interfaces in partially water-saturated soil pore spaces, and their partitioning at different air-water interfaces including those residing between soil grains and those arising in thin water films on soil grain surfaces. To address these challenges, I develop mechanistic pore-scale models and analytical upscaling frameworks that capture the physical transport mechanisms unique to PFAS. The *ultimate goal* is to bridge the gap between pore-scale understandings and field-scale modeling concepts for better characterizing the PFAS transport behaviors and developing effective remediation strategies in the real-world subsurface environment.

## Water evaporation and heat transfer in soils near the land surface
> Evaporation of water from soils is a key physical process governing mass and energy fluxes at the land surface. Soil evaporation is controlled by a wide range of factors including atmospheric conditions such as temperature, humidity, and air flow, as well as flow and transport processes in the soil media. The *overarching goal* of the project is to develop coupled pore-scale modeling frameworks to understand and quantify the fundamental pore-scale processes in soils that govern evaporation at the land-atmosphere interface, with a focus on the impact of thin water films.
