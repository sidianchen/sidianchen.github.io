            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>I am a PostDoc researcher in the <a href="https://guolab.arizona.edu">Subsurface Flow Physics Group</a> at the University of Arizona. I am interested in the fundamental physics of fluid flow and transport in environmental and energy systems in Earth’s subsurface. My current research focuses on pore-scale modeling of multiphase fluid flow, multicomponent transport, and thermodynamic phase change behaviors in geological porous media. The specific application of my research is to study the transport of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in the vadose zone, the nonisothermal evaporation processes in soils at the land surface, and the production of gas/oil from shale formations.</p>
