            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>I am a PostDoc researcher working with <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/hamdi-tchelepi">Prof. Hamdi Tchelepi</a> at the Department of Energy Science & Engineering at Stanford University. I completed my Ph.D. degree under the supervision of <a href="https://guolab.arizona.edu">Dr. Bo Guo</a> at the University of Arizona. My research focuses on pore-scale modeling of multiphase fluid flow, multispecies transport, and thermodynamic phase change behaviors in geological and manufactured porous materials. My research applications include the shale gas/oil production, geological hydrogen storage, vadose zone emerging PFAS contamination, vadose zone evaporation processes, and ion transport in next-generation rechargeable batteries. The overarching goal is to leverage fundamental porous media physics to address global challenges in energy transition and environmental sustainability.</p>

    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I am a PostDoc researcher in the <a href="https://guolab.arizona.edu">Subsurface Flow Physics Group</a> at the University of Arizona. I am interested in the fundamental physics of fluid flow and transport in environmental and energy systems in Earth’s subsurface. My current research focuses on pore-scale modeling of multiphase fluid flow, multicomponent transport, and thermodynamic phase change behaviors in geological porous media. The specific application of my research is to study the transport of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in the vadose zone, the nonisothermal evaporation processes in soils at the land surface, and the production of gas/oil from shale formations.</p>
