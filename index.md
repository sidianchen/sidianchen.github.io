I am a PostDoc researcher in the [Subsurface Flow Physics Group](https://guolab.arizona.edu) at the University of Arizona. I am interested in the fundamental physics of fluid flow and transport in environmental and energy systems in Earth’s subsurface. My current research focuses on pore-scale modeling of multiphase fluid flow, multicomponent transport, and thermodynamic phase change behaviors in geological porous media. The specific application of my research is to study the transport of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in the vadose zone, the nonisothermal evaporation processes at the land surface, and the production of gas/oil from shale formations.
